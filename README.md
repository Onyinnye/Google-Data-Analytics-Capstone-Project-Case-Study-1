# Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Project
For this capstone project, I analysed the Cyclistic bikeshare dataset and gained insights about
- How casual riders can be converted to annual members
- The best time for digital media advert
- Time of the day, day of the week and month with the highest bike count
I enjoyed working on this project because I learnt R programming language in the Google Data ANalytics professional certification
and decided to explore the program.
I hope you enjoy going through this project as I enjoyed working on it ðŸ˜ƒ ðŸ˜ƒ
